on issues with cash flow equation
when income enters this equation with a one month lag (cash in present period equals income from previous period) it gives problems.
Try it instead with present month income. 

relating to demographics. 
- there is no purchase/sale variables for calves. Either fix this variable at zero or add it to the demog equations

WOW. 
some notes
-if you run the model with only one year in inter-temporal horizon, you have to fix sales/purchases in month 12
-the inclusion of the risk module seems to be important, as it keeps animal numbers in check (higher risk associated with buying selling, more realistic)
-also, holding all else constant, adding the output scenario makes the model perform better. 



model works better when risk module is on
model works better when output scenario is on
fixed cotton seed cake to zero

reduced the minimum number of bulls to 0.04 times cows
RE-INTRODUCED crop income into objective
revise off farm income, start cash, labour available from home (not more than 6 people)
reduced arable land, and total ag land available
reduced variability of livestock prices 
eliminated the bull in initial year for hh2 (dont need a bull if you own improved cows, use AI)

the income, cash balance, expenses, herd demographic nexus


when you don't have the output scenario on (for a house with improved cows), the numbers drop almost to zero. In other words, high risk, little opportunity for stable revenue --> 
decline in investment into dairy. 

holding all else constant, when the output contract option is introduced,

a note about the typology. Shikuku et al 17 group households into local cattle only, improved cattle only. this might be a necessity so as not to confuse the different management practices stemming fromt the different requirements/production coefficients. 
took the upper bound on milk marketed via contract out. 


eliminate the intensity index?
